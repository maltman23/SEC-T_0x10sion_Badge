The SEC-T 0x10sion Music Synthesizer Badge is a kit that attendees of SEC-T 0x10sion 2024 must solder together.
It is an Arduino-compatible music synthesizer kit with:
* a touch keyboard
* built-in speaker/amp
* audio output jack (for high-quality audio)
* 5 programmable RGB LEDs

It is designed to be perfect for total beginners to learn to solder and complete successfully.

The SEC-T Synth Badge comes with a pre-programmed music synthesizer that makes way cool sounds and music and noise.
Once soldering is completed, the SEC-T Synth Badge is a really nice, portable, performing musical instrument!

The SEC-T Synth Badge kit is based on the ArduTouch music synthesizer kit by Mitch Altman / Cornfield Electronics,
which is fully Open Hardware, with a CC BY-SA 4.0 license.

The SEC-T Synth Badge makes use of a modified ArduTouch library, which is available for
programming in more super nice synthesizer features, and for making your own synthesizers.
The library comes with examples (with more to come) that serve as a nice tutorial
on how to create your own SEC-T Synth Badge synthesizers (which are Arduino sketches).

The SEC-T Synth Badge is really just an Arduino Uno clone
with the features listed above, a couple of extra buttons, and a four of pots (for playing music and controlling the sounds).
The ArduTouch Arduino Library is where the real magic comes from!

For those who want to learn more, the documentation teaches the basics of Digital Signal Processing for audio generation.

The SEC-T Synth Badge kit is fully Open Hardware, with a CC BY-SA 4.0 license.
